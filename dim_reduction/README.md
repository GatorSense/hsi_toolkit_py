hsitoolkit/dim_reduction

Suite of dimensionality reduction methods implemented so far:
-hierarchicalDimensionalityReduction: Dimensionality reduction by averaging wavelengths with similar distribution of pixel values based on KL-divergence and hierarchical clustering  

Suite of dimensionality reduction methods in progress: (whitening work, reduction may not?)
-MNF: maximum noise fraction
