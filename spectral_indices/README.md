# Gatorsense HSI Toolkit - Spectral Indices

Location: hsi_toolkit_py/spectral_indices

This code base contains common spectral indices for vegetation analysis. Also, referred to as Vegetation Indices (VIs) in the literature. These indices have been designed for hyperspectral imagery, but can be used on multi-spectral imagery also. Each function contains citation for original spectral index calculation. A demo (DEMO_spectral_indices.py) has been created that will calculate all VIs listed below. 

More information about VIs can be found in this book chapter: 
Roberts, D.A., Roth, K.L, Wetherley, E.B., Meerdink, S.K., & Perroy, R.L. (2019). Chapter 1: Hyperspectral Vegetation Indices, in: Hyperspectral Remote Sensing of Vegetation (second edition), CRC Press, New York.

## Current suite of VIs:
  * ndvi_vi: calculates the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
  * evi_vi: calculates the Enhanced Vegetation Index
